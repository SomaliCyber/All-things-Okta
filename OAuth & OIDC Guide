OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are industry standard protocols for user authentication and authorization. Okta identity solutions are based on these standards.
OAuth 2.0 controls and delegates authorization to access a protected resource, like your web app, native app, or API service. It provides API security through scoped access tokens.
OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 with user authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. It enables you to retrieve and store authentication information about your end users. It also defines several OAuth 2.0 scopes to enable applications to access user profile information.
